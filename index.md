The Software Component Verification Standard (SCVS) is a community-driven effort to establish a framework for 
identifying activities, controls, and best practices, which can help in identifying and reducing risk in a software 
supply chain.

Managing risk in the software supply chain is important to reduce the surface area of systems vulnerable to exploits,
and to measure technical debt as a barrier to remediation.

Raising the bar for supply chain assurance requires the active participation of risk managers, mission owners, and 
business units like legal and procurement, which have not traditionally been involved with technical implementation. 

Determination of risk acceptance criteria is not a problem that can be solved by enterprise tooling: it is up to risk
managers and business decision makers to evaluate the advantages and trade-offs of security measures based on system
exposure, regulatory requirements, and constrained financial and human resources. Mandates that are internally
unachievable, or that bring development or procurement to a standstill, constitute their own security and institutional
risks. 

SCVS is designed to be implemented incrementally, and to allow organizations to phase in controls at different levels 
over time.

### SCVS has the following goals:

* Develop a common taxonomy of activities, controls, and best-practices that can reduce risk in a software supply chain
* Devise a path to baseline and mature software supply chain vigilance

### Availability

The SCVS project has released version 1.0.0.RC.1 as a public preview. This release is the result of continuous 
collaboration among a team of volunteers and subject matter experts.

SCVS is available (in English) as PDF, Word (docx), JSON, or XML. It can also be 
[read online via GitBook](https://owasp-scvs.gitbook.io/scvs/).

### Translations

The project maintainers are actively looking for volunteers to translate SCVS into a number of languages. Please 
reach out on the projects Slack channel or on GitHub if interested.
